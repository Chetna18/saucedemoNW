# saucedemoNW
In this Project, I used POM hybrid framework using TestNG to create a UI Automation against www.saucedemo.com which logs into the site, sort the items, add a few items to the cart, remove items form cart and after asserting everything performs checkout.

## Requirements:
```
Eclipse IDE
jdk 1.8
maven 3.6.3
Selenium 3.7
TestNG 6.14.3
WebDriverManager 3.6.1
```
## To run in Eclipse IDE:
```
1.Right Click on Testng.xml 
2. Run as TestNg Suite

For parallel execution, 
1. Right click on Testng2.xml and Run as TestNg Suite.

```
## Output 
It should look like this once it is done running all the tests:
